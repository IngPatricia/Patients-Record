# Patients-data-base-
This is a small project which follows OOP in java, a combination of files are needed to run the
whole application. The project itself simulates a record of patients for a medical centre.

Data structures used:

This project is made up of nine files which have different purposes. Such as the "Patient" object,  "PatientRecordGUI" class, "PatientTester", "PatientApplication Runner", "PatientRecords", "DOMEctractor", "DOMUtilities", "FileToDocumentConverter", and "XMLNodeFactory". As the project is described, it will be included which files were provided, and if modified/studied. As well as how the rest were created. 

A class called "Patient" was provided to us (the students) to begin with. It cotains basic details of what the "patient object is" such as name, address, gender , age etc. These are part of the constructor and neccesary when creating a new patient. I deep understading of this class was carried out, and the following changes were made: 
  - containsSymbols(String number) method was created 
  - main class was placed in a separe file in other file. 
  - ExtractToXML button added. 
  - toString() method was overwritten
  



This is what the class "PientsApplicationRunner" initially does (the starting point)
